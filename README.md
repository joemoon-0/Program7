# UMKC--C++-Project3
CS201R

A C++ project from a 200-level programming course.<br/>
Program objectives include:<br/>
--> Employing various data structures (queues, stacks, lists) to process data<br/>
--> Employing class hierarchy through inheritance<br/>
--> Using I/O and manipulating the data<br/>

This program is a discrete-time simulation that analyzes data from a hypothetical university<br/>
print shop.  Various time simulations are conduct in order to determine which printing queue<br/>
structure would result in the most efficient use of the shop's resources while saving their<br/>
customers valuable time.
